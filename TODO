Flask Sessions
==============

Just use session and make sure a SECRET_KEY is set.


Required
========

- Implement sessions and make activities/sessions only visible to you
  - put hashid and strava_id into the session
  - client side vs server side

- Allow non-authenticated or non-owners only to /users/<hashid>/tours/<hashid>/map

- After Connect with Strava, redirect to /users/<hashid>

- /tours/<hashid> and /tours/<hashid>/map should share a widget showing
  and overview of the tour

- Trivial polling process triggered with clock?
  - add fetch_states table
    - full_fetch_completed, full_fetch_current_page, full_fetch_per_page
    - incremental_fetch looking at the last two weeks only

 - Disable the /tours blueprint


Nice to have
============

- Make popups reactive?

- Show some status about the fetch process

- Allow switching the tile layer:
  - OSM
  - mapbox
  - google terrain

 - Make fetching celery based

 - Add country to Users table...



Nice to have Code stuff
=======================

- MySQL support for Python 3 is a bit complicated
  - https://stackoverflow.com/a/15508403

- separate views into views/controllers
  - maybe for an API, but not necessary

- Could /users/<hashid>/tours/<hashid> work with two separate blueprints?



Done
